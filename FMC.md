[FMC mezzanine cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FPGA_Mezzanine_Card) require a carrier.

In the [uTCA Ecosystem](https://github.com/sinara-hw/meta/wiki/uTCA), both [Sayma](https://github.com/sinara-hw/meta/wiki/Sayma) and [Metlino](https://github.com/sinara-hw/Metlino/wiki) have an FMC slot.

In the [EEM ecosystem](https://github.com/sinara-hw/meta/wiki/EEM) there is not currently an FMC carrier.  However, once we switch over to  [CPCIS](https://github.com/sinara-hw/meta/wiki/Compact-PCI-Serial-EEM-ecosystem) there will be a [system board](https://ohwr.org/project/diot-sb-zu/wikis/home) available with FMC as well as a simple peripheral [FMC Carrier](https://ohwr.org/project/diot/wikis/diot-fmc-carrier).  See [this issue](https://github.com/sinara-hw/meta/issues/56) for discussion.
